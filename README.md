# Phuket2-Soft-Access-Point
If you don't have Internet access you can make the ESP32 a hotspot.
In some cases, (when you don’t have a router nearby). you set the ESP boards as an access point (hotspot), you can be connected to them using any device with Wi-Fi capabilities without the need to connect to your router.









Because the ESP doesn’t connect further to a wired network (like your router), it is called soft-AP (soft Access Point).
We will start with a ‘Hello World’ version of the project.
Here is the code. Upload it to boot.py in your ESP32. Go to the IP address default: 192.168.4.1 and you will enter the webpage of the ESP32.
